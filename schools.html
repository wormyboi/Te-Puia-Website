                    <p>
                        Since the first intake to Te Wānanga Whakairo, in 
                        1967, students have been learning under the expert 
                        guidance of master carvers who were once trainees 
                        at the school.

                        of the flax bush, was built in 1994. At this 
                        school, students have the honour of learning 
                        traditional Māori weaving techniques, as taught by 
                        experienced tutors.
