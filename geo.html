            <h2>Geothermal Valley</h2>
            <p>
                There are over 500 pools and 65 geyser vents, each with their
                 own name, are found in the 70 hectare Te Whakarewarewa 
                 geothermal valley in Rotorua.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our traditional Maori explanation of Te Whakarewarewa 
                Geothermal Valley states that this place was one of the area’s
                 ‘Te Pupu’ and ‘Te Hoata’, the Goddesses of Fire, emerged 
                 from the earth’s core while trying to find their brother 
                 Ngātoro-i-rangi, who was stranded on Mount Tongariro. As 
                 they rose to the surface looking for their brother, they
                 left part of the fire they carried, creating geysers, hot
                 springs and mud pools, creating the geothermal activity 
                  that remains today.
