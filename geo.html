            <h2>Geothermal Valley</h2>
            <p>
                There are over 500 pools and 65 geyser vents, each with their
                 own name, are found in the 70 hectare Te Whakarewarewa 
                 geothermal valley in Rotorua.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our traditional Maori explanation of Te Whakarewarewa 
                Geothermal Valley states that this place was one of the area's
                 'Te Pupu' and 'Te Hoata', the Goddesses of Fire, emerged 
                 from the earth's core while trying to find their brother 
                 Ngātoro-i-rangi, who was stranded on Mount Tongariro. As 
                 they rose to the surface looking for their brother, they
                 left part of the fire they carried, creating geysers, hot
                 springs and mud pools, creating the geothermal activity 
                  that remains today.

                <h3>Geysers</h3>
                <p>
                    The main geyser at Te Puia is called “Pohutu” which means 
                    “Big splash” and erupts up to heights of 30 meters. Pohutu 
                    is semi-predictable, as she plays 15-20 minutes after 
                    another of our active geysers. According to Maori culture, 
                    geysers are viewed as gifts from the gods.<br>
                    To the left of Pohutu (when viewing from the bridge) is the 
                    “Prince of Wales Feathers” Geyser - named after Prince 
                    Edward Albert visited here in the 1900's. It was 
                    traditionally named the “Tohu” or sign as it usually plays 
                    10 mins before and then simultaneously with Pohutu and 
                    reaches heights of up to seven metres (almost 23 feet).<br>
                    The “Kererū” Geyser erupts every few days from the 
                    blackened crater closest to Puarenga Stream. The 
                    fan-shaped jet can reach heights of up to 15 metres (just 
                    over 49 feet). It is named after the New Zealand Pigeon.<br>

                <h3>Mud Pools</h3>
                <p>
                    The mud pool is the result of acid gases and steam that 
                    cause the decomposition of minerals (feldspars) to form a 
                    clay called kaolin. Kaolin is white when pure, but finely 
                    divided black sulphur turns it to grey.<br>
                    The activity varies with the amount of rainfall, but the 
                    temperature of the steaming bursts of mud is approximately 
                    90-95 degrees Celsius (194-203 degrees Fahrenheit).<br>
                    This mud pool is also known as the “Frog Pool” because of 
                    the similarity between the plopping mud and leaping 
                    frogs.<br>
                    Some pools contain mud with medicinal properties that are 
                    used to treat skin, rheumatic and arthritic ailments. 
                    Māori traditionally used the mud to treat stomach 
                    infections by mixing a small amount with water and 
                    drinking it.<br>
                    Mud pools are created in areas that have limited hot 
                    water, but abundant supplies of steam and rock.<br>
                    That “pongy” smell Rotorua is famous for is due to 
                    hydrogen sulphide released by geothermal features. When 
                    released into the air, the hydrogen sulphide reacts with 
                    oxygen, creating sulphuric acid. This acid has the ability 
                    to dissolve rock into fine particles of silica and clay, 
                    and when combined with a small supply of water, a mud 
                    pool is created.<br>
                    The Rotorua Thermal Mud used in face masks and other 
                    beauty products is sourced from mud pools about ten times 
                    the size of Ngāmōkaiakoko Mud Pool. You can purchase some 
                    of these products from Te Puia's Gift Shop.
